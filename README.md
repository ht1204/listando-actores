# Listando Actores (Listing Actors)

A RoR-MVC project for listing actors

## Requirements
- Install Ruby Version 2.7.6 in your local machine. I recommend [check this](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/).
- Write these commands:
  * `bundle install`,If there is any issue with `bundle`, write `gem install bundler` and try again.
  * `yarn install` . If there is any issue with `yarn`, remove the file `yarn.lock` and try again.
  * `rails db:migrate`
  * `rails db:seed`

- Use node v14.15.5, I recommend nvm for management of node versions.

- Rails framework should be installed and run server in project directory:

```
rails server
```

- The app must be running with this default route: `http://localhost:3000/`
- Go to route `http://localhost:3000/actors`. A list of actors should appear.
